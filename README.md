Installation instructions:

The entire directory should be installed on a user's computer (not on the WideOrbit server computer).

On the WideOrbit server, the user must create another directory: 'NowPlaying'.

Inside this, they must place an HTML template file. (Please see example file, 'template-sample.html'.)

Also, in it they may place a file of FTP commands (if they cannot FTP to the webserver from their own, user computer).
